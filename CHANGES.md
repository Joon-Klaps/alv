# Changes since last version

## Introduced in version 1.0.5

* Explicitly start with "/usr/bin/env python3" instead of "/usr/bin/env python". Hoping that will
  help users that have not yet migrated to v3.
* Added v3 requirement in setup.py as well, using advice from Tobias Jakobi. Solves issue #1 on github.com.
