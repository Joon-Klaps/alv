The nadh3 data is from PMID:19030769, which is the same as shown in the MACSE v2 paper.
Note that there are 35 sequences downloaded, but the MACSE paper mentions 15 genes.

Removed 4 compelete mt genomes.

Removing all sequences annotated as "partial"

Now noting that the seqs are nd4L, not nd3... Renaming the files!
